NBA player performance should best be viewed in comparison to their peers. However, player stats are generally stated in a vacuum without the necessary context to reasonably interpret its value. For example, if we are told a player scores 22 points a game in 40 minutes, it's hard to interpret how impressive this actually is. Is this above or below average? If so, by how much? And if they are above average, is this a skill which is limited within that player's position, or is there a surplus?
