title: Reimagining the NBA Playoffs System
date: 2018-02-23

Every NBA season come April, fans start to analyze what seeding will give their team the best chance to succeed. The current playoff tournament follow a simple, rigid structure for which seeds play one another: seed 1 plays 8, 2 plays 7, 3 plays 6, and 4 plays 5 in the first round in each conference and follow a simple bracket to the championship. So its easy for NBA fans to start weighing the good and bad consequences of the bracket their team falls into, and perhaps start rooting to fall into a particular bracket that seems to have the easiest path the the championship. Sometimes its a pretty simple argument for what seeds are most valuable - like in the Eastern Conference avoid Lebron's bracket. Sometimes its team specific: maybe Spurs fans would rather play a defensive grind-it-out series against Utah (it almost pains me to imagine it) instead of taking on a high-octane Nuggets offense this season. 

As much fun as playing out these scenarios after each game in April is, the current playoff structure in inefficient and lacks basic fairness. Its perhaps a near-ideal system if regular season standings directly reflected the strength of teams, but because of a nubmer of factors - injuries, playoff basketball is different, etc. - it's a frequent occurence that the teams with higher seeds end up having to play stronger teams than teams with a lower one. While home court advantage may make it so that having a higher seed is still almost always optimal, it doesn't mean that the system as designed is particularly fair to the teams that fought for the best records. 

I've had a simple idea that I've bounced around over the past few months to make the playoff structure more fair, and in the NBA in particular (in theory this could be applied to any sport), it could help to fix other challenges the league has been facing. 

Here's the idea: rather than a rigid playoff structure where your seeding determines who you play, the top seeds should get to choose their opponent from the pool of playoff teams. Once that team chooses, the team with the highest seed of the remaining teams gets to choose who they want to play and so on. Then in each consecutive round, teams would do the same.

### What it Would Look Like

Let's walk through a simple example using the current Eastern Conference playoff teams: 

1. Raptors
2. Celtics
3. Cavaliers
4. Wizards
5. Pacers
6. Bucks
7. 76ers
8. Heat

After the last game of the regular season, the Raptors would get first choice at their first round opponent. Perhaps they just go with the traditional format and chose the 8th seeded heat. The Celtics choose next. They could do the same and choose to play the 76ers, but in this scenario there are 4 teams with virtually the same record and they may choose to go with another team that they matchup better against - maybe the Pacers. The Cavs would be next to choose, and maybe John Wall is back and they decide to take on the 76ers. The last team two teams would be matched automatically, in this case the Wizards and Bucks. In the second round, remaining teams would go through the same process. 

Why should the NBA use a playoff structure like this instead of its current rigid format? Well, simply put this system is just more fair to the teams with the higher seed. Its a bad assumption that the lowest seed team is the team you want to play. There's a number of more tangible outcomes from this system that the NBA could benefit from in my mind: 

### Adding Even More Drama
The drama of teams selecting their opponents would be awesome
This should actually be televised if possible. In the age of players taking to social media to speak out about being 'disrespected', can you imagine the uproar if a team chooses to play a team that doesn't have the lowest seed. If Boston really chose to play the Pacers instead of the Sixers or Bucks? It would be fun, both for the talking heads who'll bask in the added tension in the series as well as basketball twitter and the analytics crowd that will want to analyze what the right decision for teams in this situation is. And there will probably be a little extra passion in the underdog team to make that higher seed regrets its decision. I think this would be awesome. 

### Rewarding Success
A more reliable reward for regular season success makes the regular season more important. Choosing your opponent gives you a competitive advantage, and in most seasons it can have a big impact on making it deeper into the playoffs. The current system introduces randomness - besides home court advantage why play for the 2nd seed instead of the 3rd seed if its not a given that the 7th seed is a better matchup than the 6th? Why fight for the first seed at all if a good team like the Cavs are falling into the fourth seed (hypothetically)? Having home court advantage is useful, but broadly speaking mostly matters if the series goes to 7 games. Choosing your opponent, now that could be worth being more aggressive in the regular season. 

### Lower Seeds Can Catch a Break
The 7th and 8th seed become more valuable than they currently are
Part of the reason teams are tanking more is its becoming more and more understood by broader NBA audiences that getting an 8th seed really isn't worth it. 8th seeds in the NBA almost never win in a 7 game series, barring major injury (or Baron Davis), and almost always get swept because number 1 seeds tend to be really good. Currently, teams that are in those 9th, 10th, and 11th seeds often decide to just develop younger players and get a higher pick this season rather than play for the playoffs for the right to lose in 4 games. But in this proposed system, a team that enters the playoffs on a hot streak, maybe jumping from the 10th seed to the 8th seed over the last month could be a team that the 1st seed decides to avoid, greatly increasing the 8th seeds opportunity to make noise in the playoffs. I'm not saying this would end tanking - but I think it could help in a similar way to the play-in tournament idea (but much easier to implement).

### Easing into a 1-16 Tournament
It makes it easier to go to a conference-agnostic, 1 to 16-seed playoff system
There's been a lot of discussion over getting rid of the 2 conference system and moving to a system where the best 16 teams make the playoffs. One of the big arguments against this is the travel considerations in the playoffs. Matchups between Miami and Portland or Boston and Golden State, and even ones less drastic, will involve more travel which means more fatigue for players and probably lower quality basketball. This system could really lessen this hazard of a conference-less system, since teams could factor in travel distance into their choice. For instance, Golden State could choose to just play a team they are closer to than play the lowest seed if that team ends up being on the east coast. The conference inequity arguments seem to have died down a bit since the East stepped up this season, but implementing this proposed system could make a 1 to 16, conference-free playoff system possible. 

### Would it Ever Happen?
While I think the idea should be explored, I'm far from an expert on the inner-workings of the NBA and whether this is something the league would find interesting (or even if something like this has already been considered). I could see some reasons why this could be a non-starter for the league. The system isn't all that complex, but it would require explaining to fans that are used to a system that is pretty consistent across other sports. There could be financial reasons you don't want to let teams choose - for instance maybe a team would choose to play a team in a better market if there's some way to make more money in tickets/arena/merchandise, etc, which small market teams may be opposed to. And I'm sure there'll be some arguments about how this breaks tradition that likely aren't particularly logical. 

Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts: tweet me - @ArvindRKal
