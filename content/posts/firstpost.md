subtitle: Here is an example post for using Markdown when making posts.


American-style dates, I know, I know. Here you can write markdown code, including *italics* and **bold**

You can have:
* Lists
* More Lists

> And block quotes

    And event highlighted code if you indent :)

    Everything works
